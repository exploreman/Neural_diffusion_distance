Copy the 'InitModel' folder into the folder of 'DiffusionMap'

(2) Trained neural diffusion distance network
snapshots_diffMap_grid.zip
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tvvgTl4t6DkHrf2whK12ewo7ATbKWMxi

Copy the 'snapshots_diffMap_grid' folder into the folder of 'DiffusionMap'

(3) BSD500 training dataset
Dataset.zip
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bUwYb-RAnF1YTi1Bnmw2La2BujQLVFlE

Copy the 'Dataset' folder to the same directory of 'DiffusionMap', i.e., making sure that 'Dataset' and 'DiffusionMap' are in the same directory. 

----
Please follow "README.txt" in folder to "DiffusionMap" for training neural diffusion network.
